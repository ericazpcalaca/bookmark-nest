# Bookmark-nest 

Bookmark Nest represents a comprehensive MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) Application allowing users to sign in and categorize their reading preferences. Users can mark books they've already read, those they plan to read in the future, and ones they are currently reading. Additionally, the application facilitates users in designating their favorite books.
